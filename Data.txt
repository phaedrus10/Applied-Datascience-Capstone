The data contained over 100 columns of attributes (i.e. features) and each row is a property transaction that occurred at a specific date. The relevant columns that were used for this project included neighborhood name, building class category (i.e. property type), sale price, sale date, gross area, land area. 

The data was sorted and grouped into a MultiIndex DataFrame, where the hierarchical index followed Neighborhood -> Building Class Category (i.e. property type) -> Feature (i.e. sale price, gross area, land area, price per square foot) -> Attribute (i.e sum, mean, count)
